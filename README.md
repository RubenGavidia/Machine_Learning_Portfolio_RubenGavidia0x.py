Other Machine Learning Algorithms

Many algorithms were not covered.

I did not cover algorithms from specialty tasks in the process of machine learning, such as:

Feature selection algorithms
Algorithm accuracy evaluation
Performance measures
Optimization algorithms

I also did not cover algorithms from specialty subfields of machine learning, such as:

Computational intelligence (evolutionary algorithms, etc.)
Computer Vision (CV)
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Recommender Systems
Reinforcement Learning
Graphical Models
And moreâ€¦
These may feature in future posts
